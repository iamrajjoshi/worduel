# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests for the Worduel backend project. The workflow will ensure code quality and prevent regressions by running Go tests on every push and pull request.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature supports the project's development workflow by providing automated testing, which ensures code quality and reliability for the Worduel game backend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run automatically on GitHub Actions, so that I can catch bugs and ensure code quality before merging changes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a push is made to any branch THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL trigger and run Go tests
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL trigger and run Go tests
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the workflow status SHALL show as successful with a green check mark
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the workflow status SHALL show as failed with detailed error information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workflow to run on multiple Go versions, so that I can ensure compatibility across different Go releases

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL test against Go 1.21.x and Go 1.22.x
2. WHEN testing multiple versions THEN each version SHALL run in a separate job matrix
3. IF any Go version fails THEN the overall workflow status SHALL be marked as failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workflow to be efficient and fast, so that I don't waste time waiting for CI/CD feedback

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL complete within 5 minutes under normal conditions
2. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN the workflow SHALL use Go module caching for faster builds
3. WHEN running tests THEN the workflow SHALL display verbose output for debugging failures

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The workflow file should have a single purpose - running tests
- **Modular Design**: The workflow should be organized with clear steps and reusable actions
- **Dependency Management**: Use official GitHub Actions for consistency and security
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clear inputs and outputs for workflow steps

### Performance
- Workflow execution time should not exceed 5 minutes
- Use caching mechanisms to reduce build times
- Run tests in parallel where possible

### Security
- Use official GitHub Actions from trusted sources
- Pin action versions to specific commits or stable tags
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs

### Reliability
- Workflow should handle transient failures gracefully
- Test results should be consistent and repeatable
- Provide clear error messages when tests fail

### Usability
- Workflow status should be clearly visible in pull requests
- Test failures should provide actionable error information
- Workflow configuration should be easy to understand and modify
