# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

This implementation plan creates a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run Go tests for the Worduel backend project. The workflow will use a matrix strategy to test multiple Go versions and include performance optimizations through caching.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Create GitHub workflows directory structure
  - File: .github/workflows/ (create directory if not exists)
  - Create the standard GitHub Actions directory structure
  - Ensure proper permissions and location in repository root
  - Purpose: Establish the foundation for GitHub Actions automation
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 2. Create main test workflow file
  - File: .github/workflows/test.yml
  - Implement complete GitHub Actions workflow with matrix strategy
  - Configure triggers for push and pull_request events
  - Set up matrix testing for Go 1.21.x and 1.22.x versions
  - Purpose: Define the automated testing pipeline
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Add workflow job configuration and steps
  - File: .github/workflows/test.yml (continue from task 2)
  - Configure Ubuntu runner environment
  - Add checkout step using actions/checkout@v4
  - Add Go setup step using actions/setup-go@v5 with matrix version
  - Configure working directory to backend/ subdirectory
  - Purpose: Establish the execution environment for tests
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 4. Implement dependency caching and installation
  - File: .github/workflows/test.yml (continue from task 3)
  - Add Go module caching using actions/cache@v4
  - Configure cache key based on go.sum file hash
  - Add go mod download step for dependency installation
  - Add go mod verify step for dependency integrity
  - Purpose: Optimize build performance and ensure dependency integrity
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Configure test execution with proper flags
  - File: .github/workflows/test.yml (continue from task 4)
  - Add go test command with verbose output (-v flag)
  - Enable race condition detection (-race flag)
  - Configure test to run all packages (./... pattern)
  - Set working directory to backend/ for test execution
  - Purpose: Execute comprehensive test suite with detailed output
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Add error handling and timeout configuration
  - File: .github/workflows/test.yml (continue from task 5)
  - Set job timeout to 10 minutes to prevent hung workflows
  - Configure continue-on-error: false for proper failure reporting
  - Add step-level timeouts for individual operations
  - Purpose: Ensure workflow reliability and proper error reporting
  - _Requirements: 1.4_

- [ ] 7. Test workflow functionality locally (if possible)
  - Verify workflow syntax using GitHub CLI or online validators
  - Check that all referenced actions exist and are properly versioned
  - Validate YAML syntax and structure
  - Purpose: Catch configuration errors before committing workflow
  - _Requirements: All_

- [ ] 8. Commit and verify workflow execution
  - File: .github/workflows/test.yml (final verification)
  - Commit the workflow file to repository
  - Push changes to trigger initial workflow run
  - Verify workflow appears in GitHub Actions tab
  - Check that workflow runs successfully on push
  - Purpose: Validate end-to-end workflow functionality
  - _Requirements: All_
