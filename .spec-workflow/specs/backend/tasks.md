# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview

The implementation follows a bottom-up approach, starting with core data structures and dictionary services, then building up through game logic, room management, WebSocket communication, and finally REST API endpoints. Each task is designed to be completable in 15-30 minutes and focuses on 1-3 related files maximum for efficient development.

The plan ensures that foundational components are solid before building dependent layers, with comprehensive testing at each level to maintain code quality and catch regressions early.
