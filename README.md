# Worduel ðŸŽ¯

A real-time multiplayer word guessing game where players compete to solve word puzzles faster than their opponents. Built with Go backend and WebSocket support for seamless multiplayer gameplay.

## Features

- **Real-time Multiplayer**: Compete against other players in real-time using WebSocket connections
- **Room-based Gameplay**: Create or join game rooms with multiple players
- **Wordle-style Mechanics**: Classic word guessing with color-coded feedback:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Correct letter in correct position
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Letter exists but in wrong position
  - âš« Gray: Letter not in the word
- **Thread-safe Game State**: Concurrent player management with proper synchronization
- **Comprehensive Word Dictionary**: Includes common and valid word lists
- **Player Statistics**: Track scores, guesses, and game history

## Architecture

### Backend (Go)
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication using Gorilla WebSocket
- **Game Engine**: Thread-safe game state management and word validation
- **Room Management**: Multi-room support with player matchmaking
- **Dictionary System**: Efficient word validation and selection
- **CORS Support**: Configured for frontend integration

### Key Components
- `internal/game/`: Core game logic, types, and state management
- `internal/handlers/`: HTTP request handlers
- `internal/websocket/`: WebSocket connection management
- `assets/words/`: Word dictionaries (common and valid words)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21.5 or later
- Git
